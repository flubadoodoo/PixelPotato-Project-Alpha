Alpha 0.1.3
-----------
 - Set up rectangles for collision detection
 - Had an issue with xOff of map, but seems like it's fixed (Note: The bounding rectangles and the actual x, y rendering positions of the tiles are separate)
 - Now correctly detects when player and tiles are colliding (Note: Rectangle not intersecting when edges touch)
