Alpha 0.1.4a
------------
 - Changed the game's name to "Project PixelPotato" from "Simple Game"
 - Changed resolution of tiles + color (now orange)
 - Made a very stupid attempt at switching from slick Rectangle to java's Rectangle class, but must rewrite classes and use Rectangle2D with floats
 - Aaaaand the game is completely broken

-----------
Alpha 0.1.3
-----------
 - Set up rectangles for collision detection
 - Had an issue with xOff of map, but seems like it's fixed (Note: The bounding rectangles and the actual x, y rendering positions of the tiles are separate)
 - Now correctly detects when player and tiles are colliding (Note: Rectangle not intersecting when edges touch)
